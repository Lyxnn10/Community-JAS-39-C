# Community-JAS-39-C
Welcome to our GitHub for the JAS-39-C Gripen mod for DCS!

We are a small group of enthusiastic players that wanted to have a JAS-39 Gripen in DCS. We are currently using the VSN model with their animations and are improving this great module. The team is adding a cockpit, authentic and unique weapons, making modifications to the SFM (based on Gripen pilot feedback) and we are planning for much more in the future. The project started in February 2021, and in a very short amount of time, we achieved a basic FC3 module, join us on Discord and find out more! We would like to thank the Community A-4E-C team for sharing some code, Grinnelli for his help with the brakes axis, Freebird and Gonzalodesanta for thier support, Megalax, Isak and 313_Paegas for thier textures, VSN Team for sharing their model with us, the DCS modding community for ideas and tips and Eagle Dynamics for this wonderful sandbox.

## Installation Troubleshooting

If your game fails to launch maybe the JAS39 mod is conflicting with another one. We suggest removing all of the mods found in `C:\Users\username\Saved Games\DCS\Mods\`. You can add your mods back one at a time and see which one conflicts

## Frequently Asked Questions
- **Q: Do you need FC3 to use the module?**
  - Yes for the AA variant (F15) (not free)
  - No for the AG variant since it uses the SU25T avionics (free)
- **Q: Do we plan to make it a standalone?**
  - Maybe, but no promises since we are still exploring the limits of development without the SDK.
- **Q: Do we need test pilots?**
  - Not currently, thank you.
- **Q: Do we plan to have a D model (two seater)?**
  - No, focus will be on the Charlie model.
- **Q: My keybinds don't work (axis, brakes, etc.)**
  - The Gripen has specail keybinds and axis, you will need to bind them before flying.
- **Why can't I fire my tv guided bomb (this includes the SBD 39)? **
  - There is a conflict with other mods, try disabling them and it should fire as intended.
- **How can I support the mod/team?? **
  - We currently do not have a paypal set up, so here are some ways you can support the development:
    Learn 3D, 2D, coding etc and join the dev team. Help us recruit members to fill gaps in the team. Constructively report bugs and inaccuracies. Contribute to discussions or questions in this Discord. Watch, like and subscribe to content creators who support our mod through trailers as well as tutorial. 
- **Q: Will the JAS39 mod pass IC?**
  - Yes, but a public server will need to have the same version for it to work properly.
