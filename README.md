# Community-JAS-39-C
Welcome to the GitHub for the JAS-39-C Gripen mod for DCS!

We are a small group of enthusiastic players that would love to have a Gripen in DCS.
We are currently using the VSN model on the JF-17 and adding the proper weapons and more.
The project just started, who knows what we will achieve!
