# Community-JAS-39-C
Welcome to our GitHub for the JAS-39-C Gripen mod for DCS!

We are a small group of enthusiastic players that wanted to have a JAS-39 Gripen in DCS. We are currently using the VSN model with their animations and are improving this great module. The team is adding a cockpit, authentic and unique weapons, making modifications to the SFM (based on Gripen pilot feedback) and we are planning for much more in the future. The project started in February 2021, and in a very short amount of time, we achieved a basic FC3 module, join us on Discord and find out more! We would like to thank the Community A-4E-C team for sharing some code, Grinnelli for his help with the brakes axis, Gonzalodesanta for his support, Megalax for his textures, VSN Team for sharing their model with us, the DCS modding community for ideas and tips and Eagle Dynamics for this wonderful sandbox.

## Installation Troubleshooting

If your game fails to launch maybe the JAS39 mod is conflicting with another one. We suggest removing all of the mods found in `C:\Users\username\Saved Games\DCS\Mods\`. You can add your mods back one at a time and see which one conflicts

## Frequently Asked Questions
- **Q: Do you need FC3 to use the module?**
  - Yes for the AA variant (F15) (not free)
  - No for the AG variant since it uses the SU25T avionics (free)
- **Q: Do we plan to make it a standalone?**
  - Yes, but no promises since we are still exploring the limits of development without the SDK.
- **Q: Do we need test pilots?**
  - Not currently, I will post here and in the discord closer to release.
- **Q: Do we plan to have a D model (two seater)?**
  - Yes, but no plans for the 2nd seat to be active.
- **Q: Do you have a release date yet?**
  - 6/6/2021.
- **Q: Will the JAS39 mod pass IC?**
  - Yes, but a public server will need to have the same version for it to work properly.
