# Community-JAS-39-C
Welcome to the GitHub for the JAS-39-C Gripen mod for DCS!

We are a small group of enthusiastic players that wanted to have a JAS-39 Gripen in DCS. We are currently using the VSN model with their animations and are improving this great module. The team is adding a cockpit, authentic and unique weapons, making modifications to the SFM (based on gripen pilot feedback) and we are planning for much more in he future. The project started in February 2021, and in a very short amount of time, we achieved a basic FC3 module, join us on Discord and find out more! We would like to thank the Community A-4E-C team for sharing some code, Grinnelli for his help with the brakes axis, Gonzalodesanta for his support, Megalax for his textures, VSN Team for sharing their model with us, the DCS moding community for ideas and tips and Egale Dynamics for this wonderful sandbox.
