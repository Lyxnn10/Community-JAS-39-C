What works: axis braking
What doesnt work: pretty much everything else
tried:
Copied files from a4
Command_defs:	Used our old file but added lines for spoilers and wheel brake axis
mainpanel_init:	edited shape_name   	   = "Jas-39-CPT"
spoilers: changed arg to what our model uses, 35
sfm_extender: Out-commented  function "rudder", made ground handling impossible
airbrakes: This includes wheel braking. 
input/joystick: added custom brake axis
Notes: Cannot find any key commands for electrical system
	If you remove a device from devices or device_init- everything stops working, even if the file being called does not exist in the folder
	remove Any file and it stops working
	See if you can bypass the electrical and hydraulic systems somehow (maybe?)
	sorry for the mess :) good luck
